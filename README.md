# Machine Learning Internship Tasks

## Overview
This GitHub repository documents the three machine learning tasks undertaken during my internship at TechnoHacks EduTech Tech. Each task involves a unique predictive modeling challenge, spanning wine quality prediction, diabetes prediction, and house price prediction. The repository provides detailed insights, code implementations, and outcomes for each task.

## Tasks

### 1. Wine Quality Prediction
- **Objective:** Predicting the quality of wine based on various features.
- **Dataset:** [Wine Quality Dataset](link-to-dataset)
- **Guidance:** Mentored by Sandip Gharat
- **Code:** [Link to Wine Quality Prediction Code](wine_quality_prediction.ipynb)
- **Outcome:** Achieved [insert accuracy/score] accuracy, demonstrating effective modeling skills.

### 2. Diabetes Prediction
- **Objective:** Developing a model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant health metrics.
- **Dataset:** [Diabetes Dataset](link-to-dataset)
- **Guidance:** Continued mentorship from Sandip Gharat
